This a project used your computer camara to move servo in it the more distance you have between your index and thumb the more the servo move


# Servo Control with Hand Gestures using OpenCV and Arduino

This project uses Computer Vision with MediaPipe to detect hand gestures through a webcam and control two servo motors connected to an Arduino. Based on finger positions, the servo motors rotate to specific angles in real time.

ðŸ‘‰ Watch the video linked in the repository to see how this works!

====================
WHAT YOUâ€™LL NEED
====================

Hardware:
- Arduino UNO or compatible board
- 2x Servo Motors (e.g., SG90)
- Jumper wires
- Battery pack or USB power for Arduino
- Breadboard (optional)

Software / Libraries:
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV (cv2)
- MediaPipe
- pyserial
- Arduino IDE

====================
SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
====================

1. INSTALL PYTHON LIBRARIES

Open terminal or command prompt and install the required libraries:

pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyserial

2. CIRCUIT CONNECTIONS

Arduino Pin  | Connect To
-------------|---------------------
D3           | Servo 1 signal pin
D5           | Servo 2 signal pin
GND          | Servo/battery GND
5V / Vin     | Servo Power

Tip: If servos are jittering or weak, use a separate battery pack (like 4xAA) instead of USB power.

3. UPLOAD ARDUINO CODE

- Open the "Servo_move_cpp.ino" file with Arduino IDE.
- Select the correct board and COM port.
- Upload the code to your Arduino.

4. RUN THE PYTHON SCRIPT

- Open "main.py" in any code editor.
- Make sure to change the COM port in the script (e.g., 'COM4') to match your Arduino.
- Run it using:

python Servo_move_with _hand_gesture.py

- Put your hand in front of the webcam.
- The program will detect hand gestures and send angles to the Arduino to rotate the servos.

====================
HOW IT WORKS
====================

- MediaPipe detects 21 key hand landmarks via webcam.
- The code calculates the distance between the thumb tip and index finger tip.
- This distance is mapped from 0â€“180 degrees.
- That angle is sent via serial to Arduino.
- The Arduino rotates:
    - Servo 1 (D3) if angle is in 0â€“180
    - Servo 2 (D5) if angle is in 181â€“361

====================
WHAT I LEARNED
====================

- Real-time hand tracking with MediaPipe
- Webcam input and visualization with OpenCV
- Mapping distances to angles using NumPy
- Sending serial data from Python to Arduino
- Controlling multiple servo motors
- Python + Hardware integration

====================
